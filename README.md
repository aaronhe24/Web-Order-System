### This project is layered as api layer -> data layer -> logic layer -> view layer

```
1. The api layer is mainly composed of apihelper.ts and api.ts files, and is mainly responsible for API request.
2. The data layer stores various data types and enumerations. Please define the data as a suitable interface or class and place it in the module folder to connect to the api
3. The logic layer is uniformly placed in /src/logic, mainly for business logic and data processing related to business logic
4. The view layer is responsible for UI interaction processing without complex business processing judgments, and directly connects with the logic layer
5. The view compoment level is only for interactive processing of the UI layer, we do not recommended to connect the logic layer directly
